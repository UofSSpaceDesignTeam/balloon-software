Below is an example linux command to run an image transmission test,
splitting the image into 10 rows and 15 columns, compressing each
chunk at 60% quality, and using a transmission bit error rate of 0.1%.
The timeout for the noise generator is 5 seconds, and the timeout for
the decoder is 7 seconds. This should be run from the directory
containing the usstv directory.
